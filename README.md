User Story:<br>
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data<br>
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria<br>
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security<br>
<br>
Acceptance Criteria:<br>
GIVEN I need a new, secure password<br>
WHEN I click the button to generate a password<br>
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br>
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br>
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br>
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br>
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br>
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br>
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br>
WHEN I answer each prompt<br>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br>
WHEN all prompts are answered<br>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br>
WHEN the password is generated<br>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br>
<br>
This challenge is utilizes JavaScript basics to take an existing code and create a working password generator. Although only trivial changes were made to sourcing in our HTML and CSS documents, our JS script is heavily modified and the main feature of this project.
